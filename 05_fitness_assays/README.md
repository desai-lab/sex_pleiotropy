### Description of Fitness Assays

FA01: Populations assayed in home environment YPD.

FA02: Populations assayed in away environments SC 30C, SC 37C, SC +NaCl, SC pH 7.3, SC -P.

FA03: Clones assayed in all environments.

FA06: Backcross - 8 parents and F1 offspring assayed in environments YPD, SC 37C, SC +NaCl, SC pH 7.3.

FA07: Backcross - 4 parents and F1 offspring assayed in environments YPD, SC 37C, SC +NaCl, SC pH 7.3.

FA08: Backcross - 8 F1 sets in YPD and 16 F1s per set of 4 additional parental clones assayed in environments SC 37C, SC +NaCl, SC pH 7.3.
